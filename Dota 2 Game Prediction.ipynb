    "Gabe and his 9 friends enjoy playing a video game called Defence of the Ancients. This game consists of two 5-player teams fighting each other on a virtual battlefield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the game starts, each player picks a virtual hero as their character from a pool of about 100 heroes. Each hero can only be picked by one player in a game. Gabe and his friends are very similar in skill-level, so the outcome of their games has some dependence on which heroes were chosen. Gabe wonders if he can predict the outcome of a game based on what heroes have been picked.\n",

    "Game Data\n",
    "Gabe has extensive records of past games between similar players. You can download this training data with the results of 15,000 games that Gabe has already played. You need to analyze the data to find trends about each hero. Hero names contain spaces, apostrophes, and hyphens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of 15,000 lines, each with 10 strings and one number all seperated by commas. On each line, the first 5 strings are the heroes picked by team 1, the second 5 strings are the heroes picked by the team 2, and the number at the end is the number of the team who won.\n",

    "Challenge\n",
    "In each of K games, you will be given the heroes picked by each team. Using the training data, can you predict which team will win based on the heroes that they have picked?
