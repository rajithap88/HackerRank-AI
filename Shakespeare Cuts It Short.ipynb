    "An Introduction to our Compression Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large volume of text from the works of Shakespeare, only containing ASCII characters, your task, is to come up with an encoding scheme, which can compress the text efficiently. Let us take a small example\n",
    "Its usual encoding in the form of bits is given as follows. Every character is converted to the 8-bit representation of its ASCII code. For instance, the ASCII code in decimal for 'a' is 97. In binary, this is 01100001. Simiarly, the encoded representation for 'William' is '01010111011010010110110001101100011010010110000101101101' (a concatenation of the 8-bit representation for the ASCII represeentation of the characters W, i, l, l, i, a, m respectively). Proceeding in this manner, the encoding for the entire block of text given above will appear as shown below. The total number of bits required, will be the number of characters in the text block, multiplied by 8 (i.e. 8N). Remember that spaces, punctuation, newline: everything counts as a character.\n",
    "There are 2756 characters in the text block above, and a total of 2756 * 8 = 22048 bits are used while representing it in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "010101110110100101101100011011000110100101100001011011010010000001010011011010000110000101101011011001010111001101110000011001010110000101110010011001010010000001110111011000010111001100100000011000010110111000100000010001010110111001100111011011000110100101110011011010000010000001110000011011110110010101110100001000000110000101101110011001000010000001110000011011000110000101111001011101110111001001101001011001110110100001110100001011000010000001110111011010010110010001100101011011000111100100100000011100100110010101100111011000010111001001100100011001010110010000100000011000010111001100100000011101000110100001100101001000000110011101110010011001010110000101110100011001010111001101110100001000000111011101110010011010010111010001.................................\n",
    "As you might observe above, each character has simply been replaced by its 8-bit ASCII Code in binary representation. Now, let us define a modified form of encoding, which permits us to encode a given block of text, in fewer bits. i.e, this kind of encoding will help us compress a given block of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of encoding can contain two kinds of codes: Codes which are 9-bit in length or 17-bits in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) 9-bit codes should begin with a zero (eg. 011111100). These codes represent the 256 ASCII characters, in 9-bits. For example, the ASCII code for 'a' is 97, so its 9-bit representation is 001100001. The interpretation of these 9-bit codes is already fixed and known, and should not be changed.  \n",
    "(2) 17-bit codes should begin with a one. (eg. 10000000111111110)  \n",
    "(3) Each 17-bit code can either represent one character, or it could represent a string of characters. (For eg. '11100001000000011' could represent 'b', '11100001000000001' could represent 'Shakespeare' and so on). \n",
    "(4) '1000000001' and '00101111100000001' are examples of invalid codes. The former is a 9-bit code so the first bit on the left should have been zero. The latter is a 17-bit code so the first bit on the left should have been one.\n",
    "Using this form of encoding, we define a set of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the 9-bit codes is fixed as per the ASCII chart, and should not be changed.\n",
