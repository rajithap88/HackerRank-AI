    "Fred is a very predictable man. For instance, when he uses his laptop, all he does is watch TV shows. He keeps on watching TV shows until his battery dies. Also, he is a very meticulous man, i.e. he pays great attention to minute details. He has been keeping logs of every time he charged his laptop, which includes how long he charged his laptop for and after that how long was he able to watch the TV. Now, Fred wants to use this log to predict how long will he be able to watch TV for when he starts so that he can plan his activities after watching his TV shows accordingly.\n",
